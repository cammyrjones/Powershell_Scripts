1. Copy to where you need to use it (you can't edit it on the file share)
2. Open in editor - set the path to your notepad++ exe location
3. Save it
4. Close it
5. Run it (right click, run with powershell)
6. It'll prompt for the path containing the logs to search (it isn't recursive)
7. It'll prompt for the file extensions to search, enter * for all text files
8. Enter the string to search for in the text files
9. Assuming anything matching that string was found, it'll open a multiple selection window - you can make a single or multiple selection, click OK and Notepad++ will open the files on the lines selected.
NOTE: if you select multiple lines from the same file, Notepad++ will just open one tab for the first line selected.
